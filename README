genplant version 0.3 - L-System plant renderer


Compilation and usage
==============================================================================
genplant requires SDL, which is available as package for most
distributions, but can also be downloaded as source at libsdl.org.
Type 'make' to build, then './genplant' to run the program.
See genplant -h for options.
To use the VRML export feature, you could start genplant like this:
./genplant > file.wrl
Now when you press M to export to VRML, it gets written directly into the file.

Background
==============================================================================
Comprehensive information about L-Systems can be found in the book
"The algorithmic beauty of plants", which is available online:

Interesting patterns
==============================================================================
./genplant -s "F[+F]F[-F][F]"              # default plant
./genplant -s "F[+F]F[-F]F"                # large slim plant
./genplant -s "FF-[-F+F+F]+[+F-F-F]"       # bush-like plant

./genplant -s "F[[-F]+F]F" -a 135 -x 9     # scifi arrow (at iteration >= 5)
./genplant -s "FF[[-F]+F]" -a 90 -x 7      # demon skull (at iteration >= 6)
./genplant -s "F-F+F+F-F" -a 120 -x 8      # almost sierpinski
./genplant -s "F-F+F+F-FF" -a 90 -x 5      # irregular hill
./genplant -s "F[F-F+FF-F]" -a 25 -x 9     # crippled sea-grass
